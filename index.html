                    <h1>How one family turned a derelict garage into a home</h1>
                    <h2>
                        Thanks to an online search error, an architect transformed a tumbledown building into a
                        three-bedroom house
                    </h2>

                        Melanie Schubert and partner Paolo Vimercati didn’t set out to buy a derelict double garage when
                        they were looking for a new home. In one online search, Schubert forgot to include a minimum
                        value – “and this was the cheapest property you could buy here”, she says. As architects,
                        the couple realised that, with planning permission, this seven-metre-square plot with no garden
                        in south-east London might just be a route to the best possible home for their budget.

                    <p class="notice-p">
                        Where the garage once stood – single-storey brick with moss-mottled roof tiles and drifts of
                        dead leaves against its doors – is a startlingly modern three-storey mews house. Built of
                        reclaimed bricks, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, it was designed to fit the family’s
                        needs – from their nine-year-old daughter Ava’s bedroom, with skylight over her bed, to an
                        open-plan party space, and even an ingeniously concealed cat door.
